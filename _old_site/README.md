[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SeleniumHQ/docs.svg)](//travis-ci.org/SeleniumHQ/docs)

We're rewriting the Selenium documentation from scratch!
Help us out by sending us a patch!
You can see the current progress of [our draft](//seleniumhq.github.io/docs).

Once this documentation reaches a state of relative stability and completeness,
it will replace [the existing Selenium documentation](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/).

We accept patches and pull requests from GitHub.
